Relentless Deathmatch<br />
<br />
The idea is to make Deathmatch as simple as possible. The server started in 2018 but had to shut down due to management issues. The server just re-launched yesterday and won't be going anywhere anytime soon. It's running on 0.3.DL, Most DM servers use the SKY plugin for better sync but R<img alt="" border="0" class="inlineimg" src="images/smilies/biggrin.png" title="Cheesy"/>M uses a private plugin that's made to make the sync more accurate than ever, Every hit counts. Apart from that the server is monitored by professional staff to ensure no hacking takes place. It also has an anti-cheat which informs the admin. Even when there is no member of the staff team online the reports are sent directly to the staff chat on Discord to ensure the best experience for our players.<br />
<br />
We've planned alot for the future, including vice city arenas and such. We have creative arenas that'll get you hooked for hours.<br />
<br />
We hope to see you there!<br />
