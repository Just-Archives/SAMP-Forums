It really has taken the world by suprise, this bug that many of us thought was not going to get anwhere has managed to swarm and thrive in the world. It has been difficult for most of us, but it most difficult for me because I have a baby daughter on the way this September, I am trying my best to fight off this virus so me and my soon to be wife (our wedding is soon) can create our own happy little family, however the coronavirus is making this an extremly hard job.<br />
<br />
I want to let you know that we are all in this together and that no matter where you are, we will respect you and you are always welcome.<br />

Thank you.]]></description>
