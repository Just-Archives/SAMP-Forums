<font size="6"><font face="Palatino Linotype">INTRODUCTION</font></font></div><i>The World of Darkness is two different lines of RPGs published by White Wolf and later Onyx Path that focus on deep role-playing and, depending on the specific sub-game, the horror genre. The setting can only be described as the modern world, but worse in every aspect. Every creeping suspicion you have is probably true, and the world is as dirty and corrupt as it often seems to be. In the old World of Darkness, each game was meant to be played separately; as a result the games often had conflicting metaplots and, despite using the same basic "Storyteller System", were incompatible when it came to various supernatural powers.</i><br />
<br />
Vampires, Werewolves And Humans Roleplay (formerly known as VHRP) has been around for over a decade. It was initially developed and managed by <b>Rudy</b>. We have an extremely large script that allows you to customize your characters in a fair and way that provides greater depth to your roleplay. This is done via Character Sheets, a system initially introduced in the WoD games. It allows you expend a limited amount of points and morph your character's traits in what you feel is an accurate representation of what it stands for. As you play the server, you will gain experience points which allow you to further increase your character traits. The combat system is usually solved via dicerolling. The in-built randomized system makes things fair for everyone, taking out admin bias and the usual "S/F?" arguments from a scenario. Given the hundreds of powers a player can learn for their character, such combat cannot be scripted, and therefore we opted for a tabletop similar system.<br />
<br />
<br />
The server recently relaunched under a new management and staff roster. The server revolves primarily around Angel Pine and boasts a small concurrent player-base of 15-25 on average.<br />

<br />
<div align="center"><font size="6"><font face="Palatino Linotype">PLAY A SUPERNATURAL</font></font></div>In VWH-RP, you will normally start off as a human. After you learn the system and are confident in your ability to portray a supernatural, you can either apply or donate for a number of races, which will take your roleplaying experience to the next level. Each race is based on a specific gameline from the World of Darkness series. This is by no means the extensive list of character types you can choose from. There's many more options and combinations to try. Check our website for more details!<br />
<br />
<b><u>Vampire: The Masquerade</u></b></div>Vampires are undead creatures. Presumably descendents of Caine, they refer to themselves as Kindred or Cainites and roamed the earth for centuries, hiding behind the curtains of major historical ploys. There are thirteen clans of vampires you can choose from, each with their own quirks, weaknesses and powers. Play a stereotypical Gangrel who can assume the form of bats or wolves like the infamous Dracula, or be a conniving businessman who controls entire cities from the shadows.<br />
<br />
<div align="center"><b><u>Werewolf: The Apocalypse &amp; Changing Breeds</u></b></div>Werewolves are a species of the shifting breeds. Thought to be created by Gaia, they are the sworn protectors of the earth and all that is pure in this world. They wage wars against vampires, demons and other creatures that would prey on humanity. Though war among themselves is not excluded, they are united by a strong sense of hatred for those who serve evil. Other than a Garou, you can portray a number of shifters. Wererats, serpents, bears and even creatures who can shift into human sized spiders.<br />
<br />
<div align="center"><b><u>Mage: The Ascension</u></b></div>The Enlightened, the awoken, the magi. These are your everyday humans who one day had an epiphany and realized there is much more to the world. They are scholars, warriors, or your everyday clerk. What defines them is their thirst for something more. They constantly strive to better themselves on their pursuit of enlightenment, and will more often than not spend their resources on learning and mastering new Spheres.<br />
<br />
<div align="center"><b><u>Hunter: The Reckoning</u></b></div>Hunters are mortals who in a fateful moment had an encounter with the so called "Messengers". These mysterious beings are supposedly the remaining Angels on Earth, and in an attempt to stave off the forces of evil, the imbue your character with power to fight the supernatural. With the power to ward yourself and your loved ones from those who lurk in the shadows, you must now choose how to approach this newly discovered threat.<br />
<br />
<div align="center"><b><u>Demon: The Fallen</u></b></div>The Fallen, also known as demons, are antagonistic characters who recently escaped from their prison. Their stay in Hell made them all go just the tiniest bit completely, murderously insane. After thousands of years the events of the metaplot caused the gates of the Hell that the fallen angels have been trapped in to crack open, allowing the Fallen to slip back to the world and find human hosts to inhabit to avoid falling into Hell again that, as a wonderful bonus also help them regain a bit of their lost sanity. Now the Fallen quarrel amongst themselves to figure out what to do next in the perversion of their creation that is the modern world where God and His angels are absent.<br />

<b><font size="5"><font color="Black">______________________________________________</font></font></b><br />
<font size="6"><font face="Palatino Linotype">FEATURES</font></font><br />
<b><u>STORYTELLERS</u></b></div>Storytellers are essential to driving plot forward, not only for your character but for others as well. Generally speaking, you will get free reign over your character's decisions and the path they wish to follow. The storyteller is there to design the consequences for your actions and relate them to you in a way that's immersive and fun for everyone involved. Thanks to the dicerolling system, their actions or verdicts are arbitrary, and the course of the action is more often than not decided by the throw of a single die. In Midnight Pulse, admins can temporarily give permissions to a regular player to spawn NPCs, map an area or create labels to enhance their story.<br />
<br />
<div align="center"><b><u>INTERACTIVE LAUNCHER</u></b></div>We have our own custom made launcher that allows you to easily install the cache and navigate the application process to easily set you up in-game. It also holds the events planning board along with quicklinks to other GTA prerequisites. <br />

<br />
<br />
<b><u>SCRIPTED JOBS</u></b></div>There are two categories of jobs you can choose from. Start off as a legal fisherman, mechanic, repairman, lumberjack or deer hunter. These jobs are easy to get a hang of and are generally interactive enough to provided a fairly pleasant experience when trying to amass wealth. After you meet a level quota, you are able to become a car jacker, drug/blood salesman or arms dealer.<br />
<br />
<div align="center"><b><u>CUSTOM JOBS</u></b></div>If you are unsatisfied with the choices provided by the script, you are also able to apply for any custom job fitting your character. Lawyers, physicians, teachers, drivers and so on. You can get an appropriate salary and a function set to you, allowing you to fully immerse yourself in the career you chose for your character.<br />
<br />
<div align="center"><b><u>POWER LABELS</u></b></div>There are a number of scripted powers that you can gain access to via the labels system. For example, if your character has the Life sphere, Obeah discipline or a relevant Lore/Gift, you will be set the "Healing" label, which will allow you to heal yourself and other players with but a few buttons. There is also flight (wings), teleporation, heightened hearing, shapeshifting (turning into birds/animals) and so on.<br />
<br />
<div align="center"><b><u>CHARACTER SHEETS</u></b></div>As previously mentioned, at the creation of your character you are given a number of points to assign to your sheet. These points can be put into traits ranging from 1 to 5. The more points you put in a skill, the better your character is at performing tasks with that particular skillset. This will be reflected in your dicepools. Each dot in a specific skill will grant you 1 more die to roll against other players. For instance, your character is a hunter in the local woods. You assign Survival 2, Firearms 3, Wits 4 and Dexterity 2 to your sheet by using some of your points. You will use Wits + Survival (6 dice) to track down your prey, then shoot it with Dexterity + Firearms (5 dice). Depending on the successes gained on your roll, you will be able to define what happened. (I.e. shooting the heart precisely, or missing narrowly and hitting the hind legs of the deer, allowing it to try and escape).<br />
<br />
<div align="center"><b><u>LABELS</u></b></div>Players are able to get overhead labels that reflect a permanent trait or something specific to them so you don't have to constantly /do it. This allows players to instinctively know what's up before they even approach you, once again providing a small boost to roleplay and avoiding odd missinterpretations.<br />
<br />
<div align="center"><b><u>ROLEPLAY FEATURES</u></b></div>RPFs are a menu which allows you to set up to 64 lines of roleplay features specific to your character. You are able to apply on the forum for Merits, Flaws or Backgrounds, which further shape your character by granting it small quirks. You could make him an Addict to cigaretes, but he's also a brilliant doctor, which in turn will reflect with a decreased difficulty to your Medicine trait rolls. The system is intricate but not too hard to get a grasp on, and the moderator team can help you find what fits your character.<br />
<br />
<div align="center"><b><u>INTEREST RATES, TAXES &amp; INSURANCE</u></b></div>When depositing money in your bank account, you will notice that you slowly begin to amass more money. This is due to a small interest rate, providing you with 0,1% of your total bank account per paycheck on top of your salary. An amount of money is deduced from your businesses, houses and vehicles in the form of taxes. Of course, you can also commit fraud and never register your vehicles, but that's a risky endeavor. Aside from registering vehicles or getting custom plates for them, you are able to insure your vehicles. When destroyed, the vehicles will be repaired by your insurance company within a number of hours.  <br />
<br />
<div align="center"><b><u>HOUSES</u></b></div>Owning a property provides you with locker rooms for your belongings. When you have a stable address, either by renting or owning a house, your paychecks are earned faster. At the beginning you're placed in a motel, but can soon move out and make your own nest, just the way you love it. You can own from 1 to 4 houses, and can custom map them to your preference by buying ingame furniture, up to a total of 300 objects per property.<br />
<br />
<div align="center"><b><u>CUSTOM OBJECTS &amp; SKINS</u></b></div>The server is running on the 0.3.DL-R1 version of the game. This allowed us to import over 200 new textures comprised of skins (werewolves, birds) and objects (swords, guns, spears and so on) that allow you to further customize your character.<br />
<br />
<div align="center"><b><u>ACCESSORIES &amp; CUSTOM ITEMS</u></b></div>On top of having 4 to 7 accessory/toy slots, you can also get custom items, which when equipped spawn an additional accessory to reflect that item. Our inventory system allows you to create a near infinite amount of items, with a specific description, market price and accessory code. You could get a sword that fits your character, a specific weapon name or even something as trivial as a gas lighter that you have emotional ties to.<br />
<br />
<div align="center"><b><u>CHECK OUT THE REST!</u></b></div>This is merely the tip of the iceberg. There's a plethora of features that are designed to make the system immersive, the economy balanced and constantly fluctuating. Car glove compartments, lockers, looting/robbing system, dropping items, character description boxes, a custom health system, intercoms, very interactive phones with contact lists, SMS history, deer hunting, masks, NPC transportation and so much more...<br />
