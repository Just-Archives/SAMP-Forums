As with any cops and robbers server, MCNR revolves around the classic GTA experience of cops chasing criminals.<br/><br />
Players can work with or against each other as cops, robbers or law-abiding citizens to earn money,<br/><br />
complete various missions and activities, and ultimately work their way to the top.<br />
<br />

<br/><br />
One of the main roles on Mike's Cops and Robbers is the role of a Police officer.<br/><br />
As a Cop, you will be tasked with maintaining a safe environment for the citizens of San Andreas,<br/><br />
by patrolling the cities of Los Santos, San Fierro and Los Santos, and pursuing and detaining wanted suspects.<br/><br />
You will earn money and score points for doing your job, and as you arrest and ticket more suspects, you will be promoted.<br/><br />
The higher your rank, the more money you can earn, and the more police abilities you will have access to (such as calling for special vehicles).<br />
<br/><br />

<br/><br />
On the other hand, there are criminals. Criminals only know one way to earn money - by stealing it.<br/><br />
From selling stolen cars to smuggling drugs across the border, there's always some way for a criminal to get ahead.<br/><br />
Of course, the cops are always around the corner looking to take you down, so you have to know how to evade the law.<br/><br />
There's no better way to evade the cops than with your very own modded up supercar, but that's going to take more than robbing a few gas stations to get.<br/><br />
You're going to need to think big to make it in San Andreas and climb your way up the criminal ladder.<br />
<br/><br />
See the <a href="http://mikescnr.com/forum/index.php/topic,47.0.html" target="_blank"><b>crime guide</b></a> for more information on crimes.<br />

<br/><br />
There is, however, a third option. You could be a law-abiding citizen of San Andreas.<br/><br />
This would mean you'd have to find other, less risky ways to earn money, for example by sweeping the streets or collecting garbage.<br/><br />
You could also apply for a job, for example as a Mechanic or a Firefighter.<br/><br />
While the income might not be as great, you'll hopefully never have a run-in with the law<br/><br />
if you just mind your own business and go about your life.<br />
<br/><br />

<img alt="" border="0" src="http://mikescnr.com/images/index/index_jobs.jpg"/><br />
<br/><br />
There are many jobs that you can do in San Andreas. Jobs pay you for performing your duties and can be a steady income<br/><br />
with next to no risk involved. Jobs include police officer, paramedic, firefighter, mechanic, prostitute and taxi driver.<br />
