White skin bug - <a href="member22fd.html?action=profile&amp;uid=343955">KateDLynch</a> -  02.05.2020
<br />
<br />
Hello, I beg you to help me because this is VERY urgent. Ok so basically what happens is that when I enter server X there are ONLY 2 skins on that server that have this bug for me: a custom man paramedic and a custom female paramedic (they're both custom skins so I don't think they have an ID). The problem is that I see them entirely white and some other members of the community have this problem as well, I don't get what it could be though. I've already tried reinstalling the game, reinstalling the game from another source, installing HD skins over them (but that would be useless since the bugged skins don't have an ID), installing a new gta3.img and... that pretty much.<br />
<br />
Please help me ASAP!<br />

If it's 0.3 DL server (and probably is since you said it's a custom skin) it might be that they're not installed properly since it's a issue to other players too and not only you. Contact server developer and inform him about this bug so he can fix it.
