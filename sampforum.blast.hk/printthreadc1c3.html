Fairly sure that it doesn't affect it.<br />
Remember, the ping is just a measure of how quick the communication between the client&lt;-&gt;server is. Players will have lower/higher pings depending on where they are located.<br />
<br />
I've played on servers where there's been a range of pings (some super low, some reaching 400 at max). This hasn't affected anything, although it has had some consequences in regards to lag for the player with the ping though, as expected.

If you server player is mostly from US, you can choose a US server. If from Asia then Asian Server. If from Eurpose and Europe server. If Mixed then choose for France or so which work ok with all region.

If you are running an English server then choose Europe as your host location.
