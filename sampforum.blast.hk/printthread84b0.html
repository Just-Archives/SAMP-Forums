The problem of fake players on Russian servers - <a href="member98cd.html?action=profile&amp;uid=285517">kernel32</a> -  05.03.2020
<br />
<br />
SAMP in the territory of the former CIS is a rather popular modification, 90% is online from here, there are quite a lot of people of the lower social class who do not have money for a powerful computer.<br />
<br />
But in recent years, quite a lot of servers with fake online began to open, they thus create the appearance of online, deceiving players.<br />
The last place was HOSTED where you could still find a server for the game, but it was clogged with servers with fake online, it is not clear who sells them to HOSTED, but after asking Russian sellers - they say they didnâ€™t sell, they say that someone sells them then from abroad.<br />
<br />
The theme that Kalkor created is not readable, servers are not blocked, this problem is growing every day more and more, these garbage servers have generally lost any fear. It's time to do something with this, this topic is being created to make it clear to Kalkor that the SAMP is turning into a garbage dump because of servers with bots, thereby new projects that are about to open have no desire to buy HOSTED.<br />
<br />
Let's finally solve this issue! And forever free HOSTED from the garbage that disgraces SAMP!<br />
Sorry for my English)<br />

It'd be nice to actually see something done about this, whether anything will happen I don't know.  Props for actually taking the time to post every IP.

What about all that garbage russians RP servers like Emerald, Platinum, Bronze and so on?<br />
<br />
If this is true (which i think it is), i really hope Kalcor will do something against this garbage.<br />
<br />
A permanent ban from the masterlist and a welcome message in the blacklist (with the all associated IPs, woulnd't be hard since many of them starts with 46 - 176 or 37) will be enough, but i'm no one to say what to do or what not to do, just my two cents.<br />
<br />
Sa-Mp needs to get rid of this garbage, once for all.<br />
<br />
And yes, i said <b>garbage</b> 3 times, because that's what they are.

Well there can't be done anything about it, because server just creates real player sessions, what gameserver takes as real players. <br />
<br />
Well it could check if for example over 50 players has same IP aadress it would not allow it, but then fake sessions creater would send fake information about their ip

</div>Now you can detect bots only by logging into the server, by activity. They snakes replace all data.

If you ban the IP addresses from the master list, they will pop up with a different IP range. It's not going to solve anything. <br />

</div>what do you mean added them? I can start a server on my local PC and have it be broadcasted to the masterlist. IP Address banning is only a temporary solution.
