Well this server can be considered as successor server of my previous project Young Society Freeroam. I decided to change server name because YSF had more founders except me. And City Freeroam sounds more simple and good for me. To say shortly, <br />
I am self-studied developer and I do such projects to make cooler freeroam servers than previous ones and I truly believe that I can make better evolution gameplay for my server players.<br />
Some people may say my gamemode is similar with Sev2 gamemode but inside the script is far different from it. Below you can read all info about this gm functions.<br />
And finally, this server is not going to be in the top of best freeroam servers. This is kinda my personal server <img alt="" border="0" class="inlineimg" src="images/smilies/biggrin.png" title="Cheesy"/> <br />
<br />
I am waiting for new interesting gamers, and btw to my old Administrators, if you see this post and want to come back I added [CF] tag on your previous nicknames, and your stats are saved as well, including bank accounts.<br />
+All players are unbanned and forgiven.<br />
<br />
Below you can see info about server, thanks for reading!<br />
