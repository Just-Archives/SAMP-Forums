			<description><![CDATA[For some months, 0.3.DL had been listed on <a href="https://sa-mp.com/download.php" target="_blank">https://sa-mp.com/download.php</a> as a testing version, but it seems that for about a month, the version is not mentioned there anymore.<br />
<br />
What is the cause of the revert? Are there some updates concerning 0.3.DL, 0.3.7, or has there simply been no reason to have DL there?<br />
<br />
Thanks!]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Hello and welcome. I'm a Blender newbie, which means I have basic knowledge of getting around with the software.<br />
<br />
I am trying to figure out as to why both vehicles and peds are disappearing when being insinde of my custom made garage underneath LSPD parking on Pershing Square. Not sure if the issue arise because of the location on the map or bad/corrupted .dff created with Blender, all by me. Here's a footage of this unknown behaviour.<br />

<br />
<img alt="" border="0" src="https://i.imgur.com/Yn4CxiY.gif"/></div>
<b>Debugging shows following results:</b><br />
1. No vehicles, nor peds disappear when spawned inside the object's boundries, BUT;<br />
2. Leaving object's boundries (reaching original GTA's object surface, ie. street) and returning causes vehicles to disappear;<br />
3. It has something to do with the original object (Model: carimp_lan.dff ID: 4032), as placed back on top of one another cease this to happen;<br />
4. AddSimpleModel function inside "artconfig" file has been modified, replacing custom object with different IDs, including the original object's ID;<br />
5. Problem has nothing to do with LODs.<br />
<br />
Should you need more information to be provided by me, I'll be more than happy to do so. If you have any hints on how to fix this issue, please share it with me.<br />
<br />
Thank you kindly.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Hello, I've been learning Blender modeling and trying to edit and make some dff models but I discovered a bug that happens only with vehicle models on Blender. Does this have anything to do with my graphic card? Is there an option/preference that I should enable/disabled? Why do models look like this, because even after exporting them and adding them IG they have the same bug even IG. I really need help if anyone can help me this is really important to me, thank you!<br />
