<br />
The official DayZ SA:MP script created back in 2012. The player base over 100 players on daily basis average hitting nearly almost 200 players. This gamemode was based on the DayZ Arma II mod and not based on the actual DayZ game. I've updated the gamemode from version 14.0 which was last deleted on the forums due to inactivity. Version 15.0 includes some HUD changes/updates, minor bug fixes and new items such as dirty food items. It also includes zombies using FCNPC and custom mapping around San Andreas I hope you all enjoy this! <img alt="" border="0" class="inlineimg" src="images/smilies/smile.png" title="Smiley"/> I will update this mode from time to time visit pgagaming.net for updates if not posted here. I will also have a GitHub for this project. For previous version please visit pgagaming.net.<br />

<font face="Arial Black"><font size="3"><font color="Black">This is an early version of one of the Gamemodes i'm currently developing. This gamemode uses a unique idea of Roleplay mixed with Zombies which is pretty rare in SA:MP Scene. I've added the Admin system, a unused V.I.P system, saving system and inventory system and few more commands and features. The thing is i've stopped updating this gamemode cause it's too unoptimazed. Currently i'm working on a new version so i'm releasing this version (which is the first one) to public so other Developers can mess with it.<br />

<br />
<b><b><font size="5"><font color="DarkGreen">Compiling</font></font></b></b><br />

<li>You may not link your server with h2omultiplayer.com</li>
<li>You have to keep all the credits, but you can add your name to the credits!</li>
<li>I'm providing this script as-is and can tell that it is licensed under GNU GPL v3 at the moment</li>
</ul>

I, H2O and known as Variable am proud to present this script to you all. It's been a pleasure working on this script, I learnt much as I developed it, and today I'm happy to share my knowledge with you. I know you may not use this script to create a server but you probably want to learn how other big servers like this one has been, was developed. I want you to use it wisely, learn how stuff were implemented and do better. I don't promise updating this script anymore, but I have seriously been working on this script from early 2016 and till this day, adding features and removing useless ones, following standard coding styles and modern techniques to provide this script finally in 2020. This script ran with over 90 players smoothly, never lagged or encountered troubles handling large player numbers for days, weeks and months. But today, the server isn't even as active as it used to be, and I would like people to learn how it was developed, and to make better than it. Thanks SA-MP for letting me get into programming and making me interesting in learning other programming languages to make my own server. I spent a long time in SA-MP, and it's time to pay-back this community for how helpful it was to me during my time on it.<br />
<br />
Thank you SA-MP, ******, anyone who helped make this script or test it, and everyone who spent time in the community. Thanks for the donors and sponsors who kept the community running smoothly for all those years.<br />
<br />
Thanks to anyone whose discussions helped me learn more stuff, and especially the management team.<br />
<br />
Thank you all.<br />
Peace and love, love and peace.<br />

<br />
Don't let it outdated, add your touch to the game and let other see your work on the main server, and you can simply add your name to the credits.<br />
<br />
You can simply fork this repository, add as much modifications as you like but please follow the same style as the game is now, and same indentation (K&amp;R).<br />

<b>Fun facts...</b><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>This script included an achievements system that was nice but wasn't really important so I decided to remove it, but it will be nice if you make one</li>
<li>Most server messages (excluding admin messages that are sent to admins) are available in language files that are located in scriptfiles/YSI so you can have more than one language</li>
<li>Important declarations and are available in the header files, including team names and so on</li>

		<content type="html" xml:space="preserve" xml:base="https://sampforum.blast.hk/showthread.php?tid=667937"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, I present to you the Moving Target Gaming Roleplay gamemode. This is a fully fledged roleplay server developed over the course of 5 or so years starting with Vortex Roleplay 1 as a base. <br />
<br />
The code is provided as is with no support being provided such as help setting up the SA:MP server, SQL server, fixing bugs etc. <br />
<br />
Link: <a href="https://github.com/Chenkers/MTG-SAMP-Script" target="_blank">https://github.com/Chenkers/MTG-SAMP-Script</a> <br />
<br />
If you are going to use this script please make sure to remove all references to Moving Target Gaming, MT-Gaming, or MTG from the script.<br />
<br />
If you wish to see the features present within the gamemode, you can check my post history or search for MT-Gaming videos on the web. There are a few on an old channel showcasing updates as well as many community uploaded ones.<br />
<br />
Some features off the top of my head are: <br />
<ul><li>Account creation whitelist (Admins need to do /pcreate to allow someone to register.. You'll probably want to remove this)</li>
<li>Fully dynamic house, faction, and gang system.</li>
<li>Furniture system. Houses are empty by default and can be furnished by purchasing furniture at a store. Players can move objects however they like</li>
<li>Driving and trucker license test</li>
<li>A full host of jobs including arms dealer, pizza delivery, garbage man, car jacker, delivery boy, etc</li>
<li>Fully dynamic storage system which can be adapted to give anything storage. Already implemented for car trunks, houses, businesses, factions, gangs, and hotel rooms.</li>
<li>Tents which can store items</li>
<li>25 types of businesses including but not limited to: advertising, clothing, car dealership, boat dealership, hotels with rentable rooms</li>
<li>Crowdfunding business type (Like Go Fund Me, Kickstarter). Allows players to create funding campaigns and get donations. Funds are only distributed if campaign meets its goal</li>
<li>Admin controlled fireworks</li>
<li>Holiday events for Christmas, Halloween, Easter, and 4th of July including minigames</li>
<li>Server wide plague even which can be turned on.</li>
<li>Dynamic door &amp; gate system. Place openable gates and doors anywhere.</li>
<li>Parkcar ban zones created by admins so players cannot spawn their car in undesirable locations.</li>
<li>Dynamic garages for vehicles which supports custom mapping</li>
<li>Dynamic side doors for houses, businesses, etc</li>
<li>Toy system</li>
<li>Boombox system</li>
<li>Hunger system</li>
<li>Hotwire minigame</li>
<li>Drug system</li>
<li>LSPD Mobile Database Computer system (MDC). Keeps track of all crimes and tickets handed out. Can lookup players</li>
<li>LSPD siren system allows addition of sirens to a select number of undercover vehicles. More info in the LSPD_Siren.pwn file</li>
<li>Prison system with fully mapped prison which includes jobs within it</li>
<li>Bombing system</li>
<li>Weapon license system</li>
<li>Fully fledged admin system including commands for lvl 1-8 admins. Level 1 are moderators with only access to respond to players /asks. 2-8 gain more access as they rise in the ranks.</li>
<li>Warning system. Admins can /warn, 3 warns = automatic temp ban. Players are temp banned twice (6 warnings in total) and permbanned after 9 warnings</li>
<li>Loyalty system. Rewards players who play everyday with cash, drugs, materials, etc.</li>
<li>Includes all of the mapping done for the server. Including tons of interior mapping used by players. Found in the mtg_mapping filterscript</li>
<li>Casino faction with functional slot machines.</li>
<li>Hitman faction with contracting system</li>
<li>Government faction which receives tax revenue from players hourly paychecks</li>
<li>Dynamic actor system. Admins can add NPCs ingame which can stand around and contribute to immersion.</li>
<li>Dynamic animation system. Admins can add animation commands with /addanim</li>
</ul>
There are a ton of other features I can't remember. You'll have to play around to see what is there. This script is very robust and was enjoyed by thousands of players over the course of 5 years. The latest iteration of the server had over 80,000 registered users.<br />
<br />
<b>Tip:</b> If you are having issues with MySQL make sure SQL Mode does not include STRICT_TRANS_TABLES or STRICT_ALL_TABLES. This will cause the gamemode to not work as most columns do not have default values.]]></content>

		<title xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[[GameMode] eLg Clan's Freeroam/Roleplay]]></title>
		<content type="html" xml:space="preserve" xml:base="https://sampforum.blast.hk/showthread.php?tid=666456"><![CDATA[I've decided to release my eLg Clan's Freeroam/Roleplay script to the public. This is the 0.3.7 version. I will probably include the 0.3.DL version later.<br />
<br />
Some notes:<br />
- To make yourself level 7 (head admin) , add without the quotation marks the lines "adminlevel=7" and "adminid=1" to your account file (remembering to submit a new line) , add to datafiles/a/adminids.ini "admin1=YourNameHere" , add to datafiles/a/admins.ini "YourNameHere=7" , and finally add "admins=1" to datafiles/t/totalstat.ini .<br />
- Admin ID 1 (which you've just added from the note above) has control over all admins, even other level 7s<br />
- strcmp is used, not a command processor<br />
- This script uses DINI. When I started developing the script in 2006 there was no MySQL plugin. There weren't any plugins whatsoever back then! By the time plugins became possible in SA-MP and a stable MySQL one was made, I had already coded thousands of lines and decided not to switch from DINI. That was a huge mistake on my side, but feel free to convert to MySQL<br />
- This script also uses Incognito's streamer plugin, cyber_punk's MRandom plugin, YourShadow's Pawn.RakNet plugin, and IllidanS4's version of YSF<br />
<br />
Some general tips:<br />
- Type /commands for a list of commands<br />
- Press H to reload your weapon<br />
- You can own up to 200'/. total shares in any 5 businesses (400'/. for VIP Ultimate members)<br />
- Type /e or /engine to start your vehicles engine<br />
- The driving school is located in Doherty, San Fierro<br />
- The bike school is located in Blackfield, Las Venturas<br />
- The flying school is located in Verdant Meadows, Bone County<br />
- Type /leave to leave a stadium, organization interior, or the RC battleground<br />
- Every 100 hours played will earn you 1 VIP point. Type /vippoints to spend your VIP points<br />
- Finding the hidden horseshoe / oyster will give you &#36;20000 more for VIP members)<br />
- You can export vehicles at Easter Basin, San Fierro<br />
- Use '/setacc [new_name] 0' to change your account name without informing other players<br />
- Didn't position your clothing items correctly first time? No worries! - type /edititem<br />
- Type /jobs for a list of available jobs and their locations<br />
- To rob a store type /robstore whilst holding a weapon inside the store<br />
- Type '/skydive 1' to publicly announce your skydive and the location<br />
- Type /headshots for a list of weapon headshot probabilities<br />
- Use /drivingschool to teleport to the driving school<br />
- Find a full list of properties, businesses and organizations at the LV Planning Department<br />
- Use /tc to communicate with fellow team members in events<br />
- Non-VIP members will lose half of their on-foot money when they die. Use the banks to keep your money safe<br />
- /escapejail chance of success is 5'/.<br />
- Type '?[name / ID]' to check players' paused/AFK state. E.g. ?beckzy<br />
<br />
Some admin tips:<br />
- /addorgroof - stand at the position where you want the teleport to be. The minX and minY are the X and Y coordinates from the south west of the roof area - and the maxX and maxY are the from the north east. The minZ and maxZ can't be the same value.<br />
- /addcctv - the interiorID can be found using the client command /interior. The doorID will either be 0 (not in an interior) or something else (in an interior). If it is in an interior the doorID can be found by typing /enexids enabling a chat message with the doorID when you enter or exit an interior. The message is in the format of something like "DOOR ID - %d. USE DOOR - %d." . Use DOOR ID unless USE DOOR is anything other than 0. For organization interiors you can get the doorID from /orginfo. Organization interior doorIDs are of a negative value due to them having a much lower virtual world ID.<br />
- /eventteamscorecolor - requires text like ~r~ for red, or ~b~~h~~h~ for light blue, etc. <br />
<br />
I've picked up some bad habits coding in PAWN over the years, but the script is pretty much feature rich and bug free. If you do happen to find a bug though, I know my script inside out and will fix it as soon as I get a chance.<br />
<br />
More info will be posted later.<br />
<br />
Edit - 08/07/2019: Updated download links (bottom of post) and included the 0.3.DL version of the script. The 0.3.DL version isn't too much different from the 0.3.7 version. Here is a list of changes in the 0.3.DL version:<br />
<br />
- The missing SA skins can be used by organizations, in events, and by VIP members<br />
- Increased max player cones for police, racing gangs, etc<br />
- Closed default pay n sprays and added several scripted pay n sprays<br />
- Closed default bomb shops and added a scripted bomb shop<br />
- Added rentable/controllable lock-ups at various single-player mission garages<br />
- Added many Vice City interiors (some as property interiors, some as hidden interiors, some as enterable interiors)<br />
- Removed Cesar's garage door and made it usable in /addpropgate<br />
- Made Doherty garage door available as an organization gate<br />
<br />
Edit - 14/11/2019: A few minor updates/fixes:<br />
<br />
- Updated the pawn raknet plugin included to the latest version<br />
- Renamed VIP Deluxe to VIP Ultimate and changed the color to Platinum (#E5E4E2)<br />
- Fixed the "action" message colors in /dskin<br />
- Fixed random weather selection for each city<br />
- Added the Easter Basin carrier door and a gate at the entrance as usable orgainzation gates<br />
<br />
Edit - 22/11/2019: A few more minor updates/fixes and removed the 0.3.DL version:<br />
<br />
- Fixed adminid 1 not having full control over all admins (inc. other level 7s)<br />
- Only adminid 1 can use /setvip<br />
- Re-wrote /transfer in a similar style to /tp (/tp also handles multiple players)<br />
- Completely disabled the MP3 player code. It is old, outdated, and the song choices (which were my own) aren't preferable to most people<br />
- When you join a race event you will be put into the longest "idle" vehicle of that event (the vehicle that has been unoccupied the longest) . When the event is opened, or if all vehicles in the event have respawned since anyone last joined, all the vehicles will have the same last idle time therefore you'll be put in the first vehicle in the list<br />
- Added VIP points. You can earn VIP points by reaching each 100 hours played milestone. Type /vippoints to spend your points on various VIP Levels &amp; durations<br />
- Added two linked organization gates at a HQ in Verona Beach<br />
- Re-positioned the mod shop checkpoints. X is more central and Y is closer to the entrance, meaning it's practically impossible to trigger the client-side script<br />
- You're given &#36;50000 instead of &#36;15000 when you register an account<br />
- You're no longer required to have played 7 hours to rob a store. Instead you must now be holding a weapon<br />
- Changed VIP Ultimate color from platinum #E5E4E2 to metallic silver #C0C0C0<br />
- The 0.3.DL version is removed. If in the future the 0.3.DL features are included in the main SA-MP version I'll re-enable the .DL specific features of the gamemode<br />
<br />
Edit - 28/11/2019: These will probably be the last updates/tweaks to the script for a while. Anyhow:<br />
<br />
- Added an alternate trailer site at LVA Freight Depot to the trucking mission. If you're selected this site you'll be driving a Linerunner and when you connect to the trailer the destination you're given will be at a random clothes store<br />
- Fixed text overlay in the trucking mission when detaching the wrong trailer after having already been attached to the right one<br />
- Fixed /collectweapons not working on-foot in organization checkpoints<br />
- Organizations can have up to 6 different weapons (providing each weapon belongs to a different weapon slot)<br />
- Organization leaders/co-leaders can use /editrankperms to assign up to 3 different weapons to each of their organizations ranks<br />
- When an organizations weapons are changed and there are more than 3 weapons assigned, the first 3 weapons will be allowed automatically for each rank<br />
<br />
Edit - 07/12/2019: A short/unplanned list of updates (because of the /payrent bug I reckoned it important to upload this now):<br />
<br />
- Fixed misleading information in /guide R.E. pizza delivery missions<br />
- /rspec won't select the player you're already specating if there are others online and spawned<br />

<br />

<br />

- Interior enex markers will only show if your interiorid is the same as that of the enex<br />
- VIP members can sell their vehicles to other players after having changed the vehicle model<br />
- Moved /setmoney and /givemoney to admin level 4<br />
- Fixed /taxi, and /buyticket (when your gaming state is role-play), request messages being cut short<br />
- Fixed /payfare not working for taxi fares<br />
- Added Limo fares (same logic as taxi fares but in a Stretch)<br />
- Organization ranks max wage increased from &#36;1500 every 30 mins to &#36;5000 every 30 mins<br />

- If you're hit by the 3rd swing of a katana (animation "sword_3") you will die instantly. The death reason will say "decapitated"<br />
- Added headshot probabilities to weapons. Type /headshots for a list of probabilities<br />
- When the game takes &#36;100 off you after death you'll be given it back<br />
<br />
Edit - 09/01/2020: Some further updates/fixes:<br />
<br />
- /addtip, /deltip, /addrule, and /delrule will send admin logs and print into the server log<br />
- Fixed /vipcmds text "VIP Commands - Level 1" displaying in dark violet instead of orange<br />
- When collecting organization weapons the amount of ammo you're given will depend on the amount of ammo you already have for that weapon. E.g. if you have 10 ammo of the org weapon already and the ammo amount for the org weapon is 20, you'll only be given another 10<br />

		<content type="html" xml:space="preserve" xml:base="https://sampforum.blast.hk/showthread.php?tid=665226"><![CDATA[<div align="center"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://i.imgur.com/ZsOUQ5V.png"/></div>
A little over a year ago, United Gaming decided to reopen with a fresh script. We began development shortly after the announcement. After a meeting with our Head of Development, we have made the decision to start a new script fresh as this script is really buggy and we won't be able to reach our deadline in time if we were to continue working with this script. We have decided to open-source the project to others whom have experience with roleplay scripts and can use this script freely, please do not use the United Gaming logo, name or alterations of the name to open your own community.<br />
<br />
This script was transferred to sampctl, please download sampctl from <a href="https://github.com/Southclaws/sampctl" target="_blank">here</a><br />
<br />
Features: <br />
0.3.DL<br />
<br />
Everything is dynamic, this means that most features can be altered by admins IG.<br />
<br />
Server Control - Perform MySQL queries, lock/unlock the server and change the servers hostname/password from IG.<br />
<br />
Permission-based faction system - You can control which faction has access to what, whether it is /taser, /arrest, /dep, lockers, etc. This is a unique system that we haven't seen in other scripts.<br />
<br />
Basic RP commands<br />
<br />
Master Account System - Connect to the server with a normal nickname and have up to 3 characters, i think. (can be adjusted)<br />
<br />
Fully functioning administration &amp; helper system. Inlcuding a warn system, MySQL errors will appear to highest ranked admins IG.<br />
<br />
Graffiti System - Spray certain spots, spots can be created by admins. <br />
<br />
House System - Houses can be created by admins, not sure if there's a purpose for the house system yet.<br />
<br />
Furniture System - You can decorate your house with furniture (The system is broken, not fully functioning but it's there)<br />
<br />
Business System - Can be created by admins, has a stock system, business safes, etc. Cannot buy from a business with no stock. Not sure if there's a purpose to the safes except depositing cash, weapons &amp; drugs &amp; withdrawing them.<br />
<br />
Custom Mappings - There are a few custom mapped interiors &amp; buildings<br />
<br />
MDC System - It isn't fully functioning but it's there. There's the ability to search players, via simple or advanced. Search a weapon(s) serial and check their licensing info. <br />
<br />
Discord Connector - Can connect directly to discord<br />
<br />
Boombox System - Self-explanatory, streams music through a speaker.<br />
<br />
Vehicle System - it's pretty self-explanatory really. <br />
<br />
<br />
I'm not sure of the other features really, but the script is pretty buggy and broken so you'll need experience in Pawn and sampctl to run it. If not there are sampctl tutorials somewhere.<br />
<br />
<br />
We will not be providing script/bug support, however, I can assist with setting up if needed just drop a PM.<br />

		<content type="html" xml:space="preserve" xml:base="https://sampforum.blast.hk/showthread.php?tid=663108"><![CDATA[Hey.<br />
<br />
Since I've went completely away from SA-MP few years ago (though, I lurk these forums nowadays), I'll be releasing my Freeroam gamemode so it doesn't go to waste. <br />
<br />
It was started over 8 years ago, last worked on it around 5 years ago, and now when I look at it - god damn, some sh*t code has been written here. All in all, I ran this gamemode on my free, non-hosted server and was hitting around 20-30 players, peaks were around 60. <br />
<br />
The gamemode is unique, I've done 80% of the stuff all by myself, excluding some small usages of others' filterscripts, includes, maps and plugins. I'll be writing a short list of features that this gamemode has, however no pictures or videos simply because I don't even have GTA:SA installed on my PC anymore. So, if anyone wants, they can provide some pictures or videos of the gamemode, and I'll put them in this post. Anyways, here are the features.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
- Integrated fAdmin system (my old administrating FS release)<br />
- Reliable player control panel and overall control over own player's account<br />
- Over 50 teleports<br />
- Over 25 special stunts<br />
- Over 80 player commands<br />
- Over 6 Parkour and BMX challenge maps<br />
- Over 5 Deatmatches<br />
- Random server messages<br />
- 4 custom made races (coded bad af)<br />
- Custom player ranks<br />
- Speed boost with H, higher jump with Numpad4, Fun Stun Gun<br />
- 9000+ objects overall<br />
- Random hostname changer<br />
- Minigames (Last Man Standing and Demolition Derby)<br />
- Missions (small, simple, for one player)<br />
- Custom killing spree system and rewards<br />
- Some more which I most likely forgot<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Some basic notes for someone who'd like to continue developing this:<br />
- Colors and camera positions can be made into arrays<br />
- Redo textdraws<br />
- Redo and fix custom races as they stop working properly after over 20ish hours<br />
- Remove unneeded stuff from "OnGameMode/FilterScript&#x26;tInit()" functions<br />
- Make "AddPlayerClass" into for loop instead of 250+ lines for same sh*t<br />
- Replace commands in "OnPlayerCommandText" with anything else than current stuff<br />
- Reorganize dialogs<br />
- Make teleports from dialogs call a command rather than having same exact code from the command copy/pasted<br />
- Finish car spawning dialog<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The archive has all the files and properly organized folders you need, however it's from version 0.3e so you'll have to update some dependencies. Have fun and enjoy, I really hope someone makes something proper out of this.<br />

<b><font size="3"><font color="Red">I no longer support this script, if you are having issues I wont be able to help you.</font></font></b><br />
<font size="1">(as harsh as it might sound you will be ignored if you contact me on Discord, I don't have the spare time to help everyone.)</font><br />
<br />
Many, many, many people have requested this script.<br />
The one true unique thing about this script was the ability to use VoIP in SAMP, this was done in combination with TS3 and with the help of a bunch of awesome people on this forum!<br />
The best way to see what this script is capable of is to watch some of videos that I made on my old server. <br />
<br />
As it has been a long time since I've worked on this script I am not sure who to credit. If you see code that you want to be credited for let me know and we'll figure it out!<br />
