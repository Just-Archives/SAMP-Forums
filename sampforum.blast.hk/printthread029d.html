I'm on a project for a complete police system, similar to those for Need For Speed. (Need for speed Most Wanted)<br />
The FS is practically ready, all you need to do is set the time each weapon will take to load.<br />
<br />
<font color="red"><b><font size="4">FS contains:</font></b></font><br />
Bar WANTED = if a BAR is full, car to the sigh to walk off Turns the MOTOR, turns the ALERT, car stays with 1% of HP (Black smoke)<br />
SCAPE bar = if a full bar, full of police fear (Marker of the suspect becomes INVISIBLE), such as "Wanted / Escape / Level Bars and Texts are no longer seen by Suspect".<br />
LEVEL = Suscept bar from 1 to 6 (Increase / decrease risk / low). (Not the same as the singleplayer Wanted stars)<br />
Bar Search = Only appears in the police, when the SCAPE bar is full, is the suspect not see more as WANTED, SCAPE BARS. She seeks sus sus in the 500m<br />
Radar = Gangzone police flash (RED / BLUE) do not RADAR for everyone SEE<br />

Turbo: Increases speed by 5 Seconds, then returns to normal.<br />
Impulse: Drive the police route forward, if the engine sigh, drill the 2 tires from behind, turn the car engine off for a few seconds. (Similar to the San Francisco Driver's DRIVE mode, Need for Speed ​​...) can easily configure drive efficiency.<br />
