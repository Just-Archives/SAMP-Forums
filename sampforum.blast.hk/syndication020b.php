			<description><![CDATA[Hi,<br />
<br />
Is it possible to add the Arabic language to the server messages? I mean, in a way that players wouldn't need to download the language or change settings.<br />
<br />
I wanted to include the language in my server and I'm curious whether I can properly implement it without difficulties for the players/newbies?<br />
<br />
Thank you.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Hello everyone. Today I decided to start making my log system and I'm confused a little bit how should I do it. Should I use file management or MySQL? I would like to see advantages and disadvantages of these two ways, if someone can provide them. If file logging is the answer, which file writing/overwriting include/plugin should I use, which one is the best? If I want to have UCP on my website in future, could I load logs from files or I should use MySQL only? How can I store for ex. chat logs there? If I would like to check someone's conversation with other player (to detect IG money selling for IRL money lets say, illegal stuff), how can I log messages which are displayed on players chat, which came from other players? Detect getting messages in certain distance, which I would use in future for displaying messages over players heads (Chat bubbles, I hav'nt done almost anything in my gamemode, just preparing it for easier work in future). Sorry for my english mistakes if there are some. Thanks in advance!<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
Recently I tought about multiple mysql connection in my gamemode, one for main server purposes, accounts, houses, businesses, etc. The second for logs, there would be several tables, for chat logs, command logs, movement logs, money logs. Every table would have lets say at least 2 columns, ID of log (A_I) and the log itself ofcourse. Also I tought about foreign keys, and how could I use them if logs would be in the main database, but would it be query, information overflow? Help me decide guys, thanks.]]></description>

</div>I'm really wondering how can I make timer that kills when player disconnect in this case?<br />
I know that i can create some custom function where i can make enum and than for each started player timer i give a some ++ increment for createdtimers and then just kill all through loop through enum, but that is not so efficient bcuz i cannot know if it is player timer, even if i do sth like flag, i need your opinion <img alt="" border="0" class="inlineimg" src="images/smilies/confused.gif" title="huh"/>]]></description>

<br />
I want to start an discussion about saving player stats.What you think,is better to save player stats immediately(When there is any change in player stats) or in timer(For example every 10 minutes to save all player stats).<br />
<br />
1) Save accounts in timer<br />
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:2px">Code:</div>
<pre class="alt2" dir="ltr" style="
		margin: 0px;
		padding: 6px;
		border: 1px solid #C2C2C2;
		width: 800px;
		height: 34px;
		text-align: left;
		overflow: auto">UPDATE `users` SET `column1` = '%i',`column2` = '%i', `column3` = '%i', `column4` = '%i',`column5` = '%i' WHERE `ID`='%i'</pre>
</div>2) Save column on which we have changes..<br />
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:2px">Code:</div>
<pre class="alt2" dir="ltr" style="

UPDATE `users` SET `column4` = '%i' WHERE `ID`='%i'

UPDATE `users` SET `column5` = '%i' WHERE `ID`='%i'</pre>
</div>Now I'm use both option :/ .Half of player stats I save in timer(for example money which changes more often) and half I save on changes(Which changes rarely;for example Level which changes very rarely). <br />
I have Roleplay mode.<br />

What you use? (Sorry for my bad english)]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[I recently realised clang-format (the clang formatting tool for C++, Java, ObjC and a few other languages) quite happily reads <i>most</i> Pawn code.<br />
<br />
You can check out the tool here: <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html" target="_blank">https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html</a> and play with configs here: <a href="https://clangformat.com/" target="_blank">https://clangformat.com/</a> or here: <a href="https://zed0.co.uk/clang-format-configurator/" target="_blank">https://zed0.co.uk/clang-format-configurator/</a><br />
<br />
So, being a lover of conventions and strict formatting, I attempted to write a clang format config for Pawn based on the conventions that the community have adopted over the years.<br />
<br />
It looks like this:<br />
<br />
<img alt="" border="0" src="https://i.imgur.com/NKCO8lz.gif"/><br />
<br />
And the configuration is:<br />
<br />
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:2px">Code:</div>
<pre class="alt2" dir="ltr" style="
		margin: 0px;
		padding: 6px;
		border: 1px solid #C2C2C2;
		width: 800px;
		height: 242px;
		text-align: left;
		overflow: auto">---
BasedOnStyle: WebKit
IndentWidth: 4
---
Language: Cpp
AlignAfterOpenBracket: DontAlign
BreakBeforeBraces: Allman
BreakConstructorInitializers: BeforeColon
SpaceBeforeCtorInitializerColon: false
SpaceBeforeInheritanceColon: false
KeepEmptyLinesAtTheStartOfBlocks: false
MaxEmptyLinesToKeep: 1
SortIncludes: true
SpaceBeforeAssignmentOperators: false</pre>
</div>The only issue, as you can see in the gif above, foreach is broken and I can't figure out a solution for it (outside of writing my own formatter - which was doing, and may continue).<br />
<br />
If anyone wants to contribute, go ahead! It would be nice to have a universal format that is also enforced by a tool that can eventually be implemented into the <a href="https://sampforum.blast.hk/showthread.php?tid=647134" target="_blank">Pawn Tools for VS Code</a> extension so source code is formatted upon saving the file to save time while writing.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[So basically I'm currently making a prop hunt gamemode for sa-mp,the project is only for fun and I want opinion from you guys which is better method for this.<br />
<br />
<b>Method 1:</b><br />
Using an invisible skin and attach the object to player,this will be much easier however I countered a bug which makes the player jump so high,I can't find the solution now.<br />
<br />
<b>Method 2:</b><br />
Create an object and attach the camera to it(I didn't tried this yet)which makes the movement easier but it would be complicated to code and as far as I know,it's not possible to make the player freeze but the keypad is working(tell me if I'm wrong).<br />
<br />
I would be glad if people can help me with this project,I will put this to github if people are really interested.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Hi, first of all let me clear that I do know what these callbacks are for and when they are called. I have a simple really simple question. <br />
<br />
Which one of these is better for custom sync/damages?]]></description>
