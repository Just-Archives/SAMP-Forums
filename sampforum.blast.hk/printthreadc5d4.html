If you are an owner of an SA-MP server, you can post an advertisement for your server in this section.<br />
<br />
This section is not for advertising anything other than a public SA-MP server. Nothing related to scripting or running an SA-MP server is allowed here.<br />
<br />
<b>Rules</b><br />
<br />
* To post a server ad here you must have: <b>a forum reputation greater than 15, be registered on this forum for at least 30 days, and have at least 10 posts.</b><br />
* Each server may only be advertised <b>once every 30 days</b>. Please make sure an Ad for your server hasn't been posted by anyone in the last 30 days. Breaking this rule can (and often does) lead to a forum ban.<br />
* If someone posts an Ad for your server without your permission, please report the offending thread and do not post any Ads for your server until the thread has been deleted.<br />
* Be sure to include the IP:Port and the website address for your server.
