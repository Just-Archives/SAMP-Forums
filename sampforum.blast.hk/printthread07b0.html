eLg Clan's Freeroam/Roleplay - <a href="memberf4c2.html?action=profile&amp;uid=5303">beckzy</a> -  10.05.2019
<br />
<br />
I've decided to release my eLg Clan's Freeroam/Roleplay script to the public. This is the 0.3.7 version. I will probably include the 0.3.DL version later.<br />
<br />
Some notes:<br />
- To make yourself level 7 (head admin) , add without the quotation marks the lines "adminlevel=7" and "adminid=1" to your account file (remembering to submit a new line) , add to datafiles/a/adminids.ini "admin1=YourNameHere" , add to datafiles/a/admins.ini "YourNameHere=7" , and finally add "admins=1" to datafiles/t/totalstat.ini .<br />
- Admin ID 1 (which you've just added from the note above) has control over all admins, even other level 7s<br />
- strcmp is used, not a command processor<br />
- This script uses DINI. When I started developing the script in 2006 there was no MySQL plugin. There weren't any plugins whatsoever back then! By the time plugins became possible in SA-MP and a stable MySQL one was made, I had already coded thousands of lines and decided not to switch from DINI. That was a huge mistake on my side, but feel free to convert to MySQL<br />
- This script also uses Incognito's streamer plugin, cyber_punk's MRandom plugin, YourShadow's Pawn.RakNet plugin, and IllidanS4's version of YSF<br />
<br />
Some general tips:<br />
- Type /commands for a list of commands<br />
- Press H to reload your weapon<br />
- You can own up to 200'/. total shares in any 5 businesses (400'/. for VIP Ultimate members)<br />
- Type /e or /engine to start your vehicles engine<br />
- The driving school is located in Doherty, San Fierro<br />
- The bike school is located in Blackfield, Las Venturas<br />
- The flying school is located in Verdant Meadows, Bone County<br />
- Type /leave to leave a stadium, organization interior, or the RC battleground<br />
- Every 100 hours played will earn you 1 VIP point. Type /vippoints to spend your VIP points<br />
- Finding the hidden horseshoe / oyster will give you &#36;20000 more for VIP members)<br />
- You can export vehicles at Easter Basin, San Fierro<br />
- Use '/setacc [new_name] 0' to change your account name without informing other players<br />
- Didn't position your clothing items correctly first time? No worries! - type /edititem<br />
- Type /jobs for a list of available jobs and their locations<br />
- To rob a store type /robstore whilst holding a weapon inside the store<br />
- Type '/skydive 1' to publicly announce your skydive and the location<br />
- Type /headshots for a list of weapon headshot probabilities<br />
- Use /drivingschool to teleport to the driving school<br />
- Find a full list of properties, businesses and organizations at the LV Planning Department<br />
- Use /tc to communicate with fellow team members in events<br />
- Non-VIP members will lose half of their on-foot money when they die. Use the banks to keep your money safe<br />
- /escapejail chance of success is 5'/.<br />
- Type '?[name / ID]' to check players' paused/AFK state. E.g. ?beckzy<br />
<br />
Some admin tips:<br />
- /addorgroof - stand at the position where you want the teleport to be. The minX and minY are the X and Y coordinates from the south west of the roof area - and the maxX and maxY are the from the north east. The minZ and maxZ can't be the same value.<br />
- /addcctv - the interiorID can be found using the client command /interior. The doorID will either be 0 (not in an interior) or something else (in an interior). If it is in an interior the doorID can be found by typing /enexids enabling a chat message with the doorID when you enter or exit an interior. The message is in the format of something like "DOOR ID - %d. USE DOOR - %d." . Use DOOR ID unless USE DOOR is anything other than 0. For organization interiors you can get the doorID from /orginfo. Organization interior doorIDs are of a negative value due to them having a much lower virtual world ID.<br />
- /eventteamscorecolor - requires text like ~r~ for red, or ~b~~h~~h~ for light blue, etc. <br />
<br />
I've picked up some bad habits coding in PAWN over the years, but the script is pretty much feature rich and bug free. If you do happen to find a bug though, I know my script inside out and will fix it as soon as I get a chance.<br />
<br />
More info will be posted later.<br />
<br />
Edit - 08/07/2019: Updated download links (bottom of post) and included the 0.3.DL version of the script. The 0.3.DL version isn't too much different from the 0.3.7 version. Here is a list of changes in the 0.3.DL version:<br />
<br />
- The missing SA skins can be used by organizations, in events, and by VIP members<br />
- Increased max player cones for police, racing gangs, etc<br />
- Closed default pay n sprays and added several scripted pay n sprays<br />
- Closed default bomb shops and added a scripted bomb shop<br />
- Added rentable/controllable lock-ups at various single-player mission garages<br />
- Added many Vice City interiors (some as property interiors, some as hidden interiors, some as enterable interiors)<br />
- Removed Cesar's garage door and made it usable in /addpropgate<br />
- Made Doherty garage door available as an organization gate<br />
<br />
Edit - 14/11/2019: A few minor updates/fixes:<br />
<br />
- Updated the pawn raknet plugin included to the latest version<br />
- Renamed VIP Deluxe to VIP Ultimate and changed the color to Platinum (#E5E4E2)<br />
- Fixed the "action" message colors in /dskin<br />
- Fixed random weather selection for each city<br />
- Added the Easter Basin carrier door and a gate at the entrance as usable orgainzation gates<br />
<br />
Edit - 22/11/2019: A few more minor updates/fixes and removed the 0.3.DL version:<br />
<br />
- Fixed adminid 1 not having full control over all admins (inc. other level 7s)<br />
- Only adminid 1 can use /setvip<br />
- Re-wrote /transfer in a similar style to /tp (/tp also handles multiple players)<br />
- Completely disabled the MP3 player code. It is old, outdated, and the song choices (which were my own) aren't preferable to most people<br />
- When you join a race event you will be put into the longest "idle" vehicle of that event (the vehicle that has been unoccupied the longest) . When the event is opened, or if all vehicles in the event have respawned since anyone last joined, all the vehicles will have the same last idle time therefore you'll be put in the first vehicle in the list<br />
- Added VIP points. You can earn VIP points by reaching each 100 hours played milestone. Type /vippoints to spend your points on various VIP Levels &amp; durations<br />
- Added two linked organization gates at a HQ in Verona Beach<br />
- Re-positioned the mod shop checkpoints. X is more central and Y is closer to the entrance, meaning it's practically impossible to trigger the client-side script<br />
- You're given &#36;50000 instead of &#36;15000 when you register an account<br />
- You're no longer required to have played 7 hours to rob a store. Instead you must now be holding a weapon<br />
- Changed VIP Ultimate color from platinum #E5E4E2 to metallic silver #C0C0C0<br />
- The 0.3.DL version is removed. If in the future the 0.3.DL features are included in the main SA-MP version I'll re-enable the .DL specific features of the gamemode<br />
<br />
Edit - 28/11/2019: These will probably be the last updates/tweaks to the script for a while. Anyhow:<br />
<br />
- Added an alternate trailer site at LVA Freight Depot to the trucking mission. If you're selected this site you'll be driving a Linerunner and when you connect to the trailer the destination you're given will be at a random clothes store<br />
- Fixed text overlay in the trucking mission when detaching the wrong trailer after having already been attached to the right one<br />
- Fixed /collectweapons not working on-foot in organization checkpoints<br />
- Organizations can have up to 6 different weapons (providing each weapon belongs to a different weapon slot)<br />
- Organization leaders/co-leaders can use /editrankperms to assign up to 3 different weapons to each of their organizations ranks<br />
- When an organizations weapons are changed and there are more than 3 weapons assigned, the first 3 weapons will be allowed automatically for each rank<br />
<br />
Edit - 07/12/2019: A short/unplanned list of updates (because of the /payrent bug I reckoned it important to upload this now):<br />
<br />
- Fixed misleading information in /guide R.E. pizza delivery missions<br />
- /rspec won't select the player you're already specating if there are others online and spawned<br />

<br />

<br />

- Interior enex markers will only show if your interiorid is the same as that of the enex<br />
- VIP members can sell their vehicles to other players after having changed the vehicle model<br />
- Moved /setmoney and /givemoney to admin level 4<br />
- Fixed /taxi, and /buyticket (when your gaming state is role-play), request messages being cut short<br />
- Fixed /payfare not working for taxi fares<br />
- Added Limo fares (same logic as taxi fares but in a Stretch)<br />
- Organization ranks max wage increased from &#36;1500 every 30 mins to &#36;5000 every 30 mins<br />

- If you're hit by the 3rd swing of a katana (animation "sword_3") you will die instantly. The death reason will say "decapitated"<br />
- Added headshot probabilities to weapons. Type /headshots for a list of probabilities<br />
- When the game takes &#36;100 off you after death you'll be given it back<br />
<br />
